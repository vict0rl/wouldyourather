## Would You Rather Project

## Project Overview

This application allows a user to Sign in and play the "would you rather" game. Where they can add questions, answer other people's questions, and view the responses of these questions. It is an application that is built with react, redux and thunk middleware.
A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. 

Once the user logs in, the home page is shown. For answered polls, the number of people who voted for the option is shown, as well as the percentage.

The application also features a leaderboard with the user's name, picture, and number of questions asked/answered.
